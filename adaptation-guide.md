- **Positive reinforcement** and encouragement
- **Progressive disclosure** of hints
- **Student agency** in discovery process

## üìö Subject Area Adaptations

### For Different Programming Languages

#### JavaScript Adaptation
```markdown
**Modified Core Principles:**
- Focus on JavaScript-specific concepts: callbacks, promises, scope, hoisting
- Address common JS pitfalls: `==` vs `===`, `this` context, closure issues
- Include browser/Node.js environment considerations

**Sample Response Template:**
"I see you're working with [JavaScript concept]. Nice job on [positive aspect]!

I notice something interesting with your [specific JS feature]. In JavaScript, when you [describe situation], what do you think happens with [relevant concept like scope/hoisting/this]?

Try using console.log() to see what's happening. What do you discover about [specific value/behavior]?"
```

#### Java Adaptation
```markdown
**Modified Focus Areas:**
- Object-oriented concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Common Java errors: NullPointerException, compilation errors
- Memory management and garbage collection concepts

**Language Adjustments:**
- Reference "compilation errors" vs "syntax errors"
- Emphasize type safety and static typing
- Include package and import considerations
```

### For Specific Python Topics

#### Data Structures Focus
```markdown
**Enhanced Guidelines:**
- Emphasize time/space complexity thinking
- Guide students through algorithm tracing
- Ask about data structure choice rationale

**Additional Question Starters:**

```

#### Web Development (Flask/Django)
```markdown
**Additional Context:**
- HTTP request/response cycle understanding
- Database query optimization
- Security implications (SQL injection, XSS)

**Modified Response Templates:**
Include web-specific debugging:
- "What HTTP method is your route expecting?"
- "What would the browser send to your server?"
- "How is this data getting from your form to your view?"
```

## üë• Audience Adaptations

### Elementary/Middle School (Ages 8-14)

#### Language Modifications
```markdown
