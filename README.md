 # AI Python Code Debugging Tutor\n\nA comprehensive system prompt designed to help AI assistants (like ChatGPT) provide educational debugging support for Python programming students. The prompt emphasizes guided discovery over direct solutions, fostering independent problem-solving skills.\n\n## üéØ Purpose\n\nThis prompt transforms any AI assistant into an effective Python programming tutor that:\n- Analyzes buggy Python code constructively\n- Provides educational feedback through guided discovery\n- Avoids giving away complete solutions\n- Builds students\' debugging skills and confidence\n- Adapts to different skill levels\n\n## üöÄ Quick Start\n\nSimply copy the content from [`ai-python-debugging-tutor-prompt.md`](./ai-python-debugging-tutor-prompt.md) and use it as a system prompt for your AI assistant of choice.\n\n## üìã What\'s Included\n\n- **Main Prompt** (`ai-python-debugging-tutor-prompt.md`) - Complete system prompt ready to use\n- **Sample Interactions** (`sample-interactions.md`) - Example conversations showing the prompt in action\n- **Adaptation Guide** (`adaptation-guide.md`) - How to customize for different contexts\n- **Design Rationale** (`design-rationale.md`) - Detailed explanation of design choices\n\n## üéì Key Features\n\n### Educational Approach\n- **Socratic Method**: Uses leading questions to guide students to solutions\n- **Conceptual Learning**: Focuses on understanding rather than memorization\n- **Progressive Hints**: Provides increasingly specific guidance without revealing answers\n- **Skill Building**: Teaches transferable debugging strategies\n\n### Student-Friendly Design\n- **Positive Reinforcement**: Always acknowledges what students did correctly\n- **Adaptive Language**: Adjusts complexity based on student level\n- **Emotional Support**: Handles frustration with empathy and encouragement\n- **Growth Mindset**: Frames mistakes as learning opportunities\n\n### Technical Coverage\n- **All Error Types**: Syntax, logic, and runtime errors\n- **Debugging Strategies**: Print statements, trace execution, error message analysis\n- **Best Practices**: Code readability, efficiency, and structure\n- **Comprehensive Scope**: Works across different Python topics and complexity levels\n\n## üìä Sample Interaction\n\n**Student\'s Buggy Code:**\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(numbers):\n        total += numbers[i]\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\nscores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]\nprint(calculate_average(scores))\n```\n\n**AI Tutor Response (using our prompt):**\n> "I can see you\'re working on calculating an average - that\'s a fundamental and important skill! Your overall structure looks good, and I like how you\'re using a for loop and keeping track of the total.\n>\n> I notice something interesting in your for loop on line 3. Take a look at `range(numbers)` - what do you think Python is expecting `numbers` to be when it\'s used with `range()`? \n>\n> Here\'s a hint: think about what type of value `range()` typically works with, and what type of value you\'re actually passing to your function.\n>\n> Try running your code and see what error message you get - Python\'s error messages often give us great clues about what\'s going wrong!"\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Customization\n\nThe prompt can be easily adapted for:\n- **Different Programming Languages**: Modify language-specific examples and concepts\n- **Specific Topics**: Focus on particular areas like data structures, algorithms, etc.\n- **Age Groups**: Adjust language complexity and examples\n- **Learning Environments**: Classroom, online courses, coding bootcamps, etc.\n\nSee [`adaptation-guide.md`](./adaptation-guide.md) for detailed customization instructions.\n\n## üìà Effectiveness Principles\n\n### Why This Approach Works\n\n1. **Active Learning**: Students discover solutions themselves, leading to better retention\n2. **Metacognition**: Develops awareness of thinking processes and problem-solving strategies\n3. **Confidence Building**: Success through guided discovery builds self-efficacy\n4. **Transfer**: Skills learned through questioning transfer to new problems\n5. **Engagement**: Interactive approach maintains student interest and motivation\n\n### Research-Backed Techniques\n\n- **Socratic Questioning**: Proven effective in computer science education\n- **Zone of Proximal Development**: Provides appropriate level of challenge with support\n- **Growth Mindset**: Emphasizes process over innate ability\n- **Scaffolding**: Gradually reduces support as competence increases\n\n## üéØ Use Cases\n\n### Educational Institutions\n- **Computer Science Courses**: Supplement instructor feedback\n- **Online Learning Platforms**: Provide 24/7 tutoring support\n- **Coding Bootcamps**: Scale personalized feedback\n- **Self-Study Programs**: Guide independent learners\n\n### Development Teams\n- **Code Review Training**: Teach junior developers debugging skills\n- **Onboarding**: Help new team members learn codebase patterns\n- **Mentorship Programs**: Structure mentoring conversations\n\n## ü§ù Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to improve the prompt! Please see our contribution guidelines:\n\n1. **Test Changes**: Validate any modifications with sample code scenarios\n2. **Maintain Balance**: Ensure changes preserve the educational vs. solution-giving balance\n3. **Document Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind proposed changes\n4. **Provide Examples**: Include sample interactions demonstrating improvements\n\n## üìÑ License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## üôè Acknowledgments\n\n- Inspired by effective computer science pedagogy research\n- Built on principles of constructivist learning theory\n- Designed with input from programming educators and students\n\n## üìû Support\n\nFor questions, suggestions, or issues:\n- Open an issue in this repository\n- Contribute improvements via pull requests\n- Share your experiences and adaptations\n\n---\n\n**Ready to transform AI assistance into AI tutoring?
